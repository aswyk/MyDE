# MyDE (My Development Environment)

MyDE is a modest attemp at making a IDE for most programming languages.

Initially it will be developed to support C/C++, however it will aim to be modular in such a way to afford the user to add what they need and nothing more.


MyDE will use 2 technologies to accomplish its goals. Vaadin (https://vaadin.com/home), which is a java we framework, and Jenkins (http://jenkins-ci.org/), which is a continuous integration server.

MyDE is essentially a web ide/text editor. You can deploy it on almost any platform, and the neat thing is, you can access it from anywhere. There are a few solutions like this already and MyDE does no try to duplicate ot better any of them, infact no research was done on these products in MyDE development. This is purly a educational experience and an effort to solve some of the issues and problems I face in my professional and personal development endevours.

I'll add more info when I get the ball rolling. A PoC is already made that can open files, edit, and save them. This with all the bells and whistles of syntax highlighting and indentions and what not.

Stay tuned.

# MyDE (My Development Environment)

MyDE is a modest attemp at making a IDE for most programming languages.

Initially it will be developed to support C/C++, however it will aim to be modular in such a way to afford the user to add what they need and nothing more.


MyDE will use 2 technologies to accomplish its goals. Vaadin (https://vaadin.com/home), which is a java we framework, and Jenkins (http://jenkins-ci.org/), which is a continuous integration server.

I'll add more info when I get the ball rolling. A PoC is already made that can open files, edit, and save them. This with all the bells and whistles of syntax highlighting and indentions and what not.

Stay tuned.
